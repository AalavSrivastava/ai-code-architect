# AI Code Architect & Project Builder

A multi-agent system that transforms a plain-English idea into a fully scaffolded full-stack project (React frontend + FastAPI backend), using tools, memory, long-running tasks, observability, and A2A communication.

This project was built for the **2025 Kaggle × Google AI Intensive Capstone** (Freestyle Track).
